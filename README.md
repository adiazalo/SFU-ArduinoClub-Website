This reposotory is dedicated to the SFU Arduino website built. Certain photos have been removed from the assets and email addresses have been revomed from the HTLM code for privacy reasons. More details will be added shortly to this file as the project moves forward as well as more assets will be uploaded to allow anybody to see and download a fully working page.

Every pull request is greatly apprecited and will be considered.
